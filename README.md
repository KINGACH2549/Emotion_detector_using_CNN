# Emotion_detector_using_CNN
Emotion detection of real time videos and images using CNN and tensorflow framework in python and openCV

In this project 7 diffrent emotions such as anger,happiness,digust,sad,surprise,fear are being classified by the designed neural Net 
The network basically follows architecture of VGG-16 Model with same size of kernels in everly layer
A dropout of 0.3 has been used to eliminate the overfitting in the model and problem of high variance.
Open CV was used to detect the real time emotions from faces

NOTE: THE MODEL IS NOT ACCURATE ENOUGH BUT IS ABLE TO WORK EXTREMLY WELL FOR FEW CATEGORIES WE WILL DEFINETLY USE RESNET50 OR RESNET18 ALSO TO IMPROVE ITS ACCURACY
